## Logistic Calculation WPF app
CZ Logistic Calculation in WPF using MVVM pattern
## About 
This is the first application in WPF where I'm learning all this stuff. And I'm not good at front-end design, so the design of this app is not very good, 
and the grasp of the grid is not very good either, but I'm working on it. 
Anyway, the backend is my thing. Later I'll add an option to switch the language between CZ and EN, but at the moment, it's only in CZ.<br />

The app now includes: The calculation of the optimal order quantity [QOPT] Inventory analysis and Running time calculation
## Requirements
Nothing, But later on, you will probably need to have:<br />
Python =<3.9<br />
Pandas =<1.5.0<br />
Matplotlib =<3.6.2<br />
